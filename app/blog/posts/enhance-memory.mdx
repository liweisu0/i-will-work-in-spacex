There are a lot to do from ground up, algorithms, data structures, system design, and so on. And I had actively found a way to remember more efficiently.

After reading "Unlimited Memory" and "The speed reading book", I quickly use the method in them, and the result is not bad.

Now I give up using notebook, only use the Anki to remember things I need to, which is really fast.
