# I Will Work In SpaceX

Everyone has a dream, and mine is to work at SpaceX.

# Why?

In the time of middle school, I read a lot sci-fiction books,
such as "The Three-Body Problem" and "Foundation", always dreaming
about human beings travel through the universe, make great history
in the galaxy, and the most important thing is: save the fire and hope.

After working, I found that only SpaceX is taking this seriously, and
it becomes the only company that I want to work for.

# Yes, you will definitely laugh at me

My dad: "You? Work in Astronautics? Don't kid me."
My friends: "Just be careful with 007 workload, you will work into hospital there."

Yup, I know, it's tough. Since everyone has one time of life, I want to make it meaningful to me.
